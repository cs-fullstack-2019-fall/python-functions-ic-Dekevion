Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a variable named favoriteTeacher and assign it "Kevin". Send the favoriteTeacher variable to a function that will display the item when something is sent to it.

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Create a sumOf3Numbers function that will print out the sum of the three numbers using the starting code below:
```
sumOf3Numbers(number1, number2, number3)
```

### Problem 4:
Create a function that’s passed a name and the number of times a user wants to print Hello [NAME]. Print Hello [NAME] that many times in the function.
